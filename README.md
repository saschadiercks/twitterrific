A collection of themes for twitterrific

## monokai (for Twitterrific 6)
This Twitterrific theme is based on twitterrific-monkai created by Jim Cloudman https://github.com/jimcloudman/twitterrific-monokai
Since the original-theme is build for Twitterrific V5 so I tweaked some colors and made small adjustments to my liking.

## nordic and nordic high
Themes based on the nordtheme from Arctic Ice Studios https://www.nordtheme.com
'Nordic high' is a high contrast version, where I made some colors more vibrant and added a new darker shade.

## How to install
1. Put the theme-file in your iCloud Drive folder here: /Twitterrific/Themes/Dark/
2. The theme can now be used on macOS and iOS by selecting the theme
